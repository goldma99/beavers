Economic production has long faced environmental conditions that threaten efficiency. Technology and industrial might have largely neutralized these challenges (for instance, irrigation enabling productive agriculture in arid regions), but many economic solutions risk distorting social welfare. A salient example remains the conflict between wildlife and agriculture. The success of farming operations often depends on the ability of the producer or its government to violently cull livestock predators and crop grazers, repel potential disease transmission vectors, and eliminate crop-eating pests with mass insecticide use. Such measures, however, may produce both ecologically and socially undesirable outcomes. Examples abound. In the past two decades, the US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services has killed 56 million wild animals, including many otherwise protected by the Endangered Species Act, to protect agricultural, largely livestock, assets (VOX CITE). Pesticides used to protect crop yields negatively impact human and animal health \citep{larsen_agricultural_2017}, leading in part to the formation of the modern American environmental movement \citep{woodwell_broken_1984}. The Chinese ``Four Pests Campaign'' encouraged the mass killing of sparrows, believed to feed on grain reservoirs, and inadvertently eliminated sparrows' valuable pest-control services, playing a role in the subsequent mass famine (CITE). 

The trade-off between securing economic production and protecting ecosystem functioning is increasingly fraught in the face of climate change, widespread habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss \citep{cardinale_biodiversity_2012}. Indeed, misunderstanding the role keystone species play in supporting their ecosystems can inaccurately shape wildlife management policy, and new evidence has challenged existing notions of ``nuisance'' species (e.g., \cite{raynor_wolves_2021}). There remains, however, scant empirical evidence on the economic impacts of targeted wildlife on agricultural functioning. This paper attempts to fill that gap.

The beaver (\textit{Castor canadensis} in North America\footnote{Kuhl, 1820} and \textit{Castor fiber} in Europe and Western Asia\footnote{Linnaeus, 1758}) occupies the dual roles of agricultural menace and crucial ecosystem engineer. Since the expansion of agricultural in Europe and America, farm operators have often resorted to beaver killing to avoid the flooding, crop grazing, and timber felling associated with beaver habitation. After being hunted to near-extinction until the 19th Century, the beaver has been reintroduced in many parts of North America and Europe. In recent years, a plethora of positive externalities produced by beavers has been well-documented, from wetland preservation \citep{hood_beaver_2008}, temperature regulation (\cite{dittbrenner_relocated_2022}), and carbon storage (\cite{wohl_landscape-scale_2013}, \cite{johnston_beaver_2014}) to wildfire resistance \citep{fairfax_smokey_2020} and the flourishing of species richness \citep{wright_ecosystem_2002}.

A recent unplanned, unsanctioned reemergence of beavers in Scotland, where they had not appeared in several centuries, illustrates this conflict. Consistent with historical examples of farmer-led opposition to beaver habitation, agricultural groups have pushed back against the incursion into the agriculturally valuable region around the River Tay (hereafter, ``Tayside''), with the president of the National Farmers Union, Scotland (NFUS) warning that beavers pose a greater threat than Brexit to his constituents \citep{castle_beavers_2021}. In nearby Southern England, which has seen several controlled releases, residents have posted public banners vowing to oppose beaver invasion (cite). Despite this staunch opposition, Scotland granted beavers protected status in 2019, restricting farmers' latitude to kill occupying beavers at will.

The Scottish beaver presents a useful case study for environmental economics research seeking to better inform wildlife management policy. Exogenous to agricultural policy, climate change,\footnote{Not all beaver expansion has been uncorrelated with the identification-confounding effects of climate change. In recent decades, the warming Arctic tundra has proved fertile habitat for beavers \citep{tape_expanding_2022}, which are further altering the environment via their colonies' methane production \citep{clark_beaver_2023}} or wildlife management regime shifts, the illegal arrival and rapid spread of Scottish beavers enables the estimation of a causal effect on agricultural behavior and outcomes.

I employ a set of periodic comprehensive regional surveys, undertaken between 2012 and 2020, to identify beaver presence and movement. To test whether beaver presence affects agricultural outcomes, I match agricultural census results on crop planting and standard output to beaver arrival and changing density within agricultural parishes. Because multiple channels exist by which beavers may harm agricultural operations, I provide suggestive evidence for the most commonly cited mechanism: flooding. Using a dense network of hydrometry monitoring stations across Scotland, I compare water levels in pre- and-post beaver periods, as well as between beaver-colonized and beaver-free areas.

I find RESULTS.

This paper makes three main contributions. First, it builds on a small existing literature quantifying the economic impacts of wildlife on economic production.

Second, it contributes to the literature, largely in ecology, wildlife biology, and environmental policy, on the successful management of reintroduced species, with particular attention to avoiding human-wildlife conflict

Third, it adds to existing literature in economics on agricultural damage response functions, particularly in response to natural disasters and adverse environmental conditions.

The paper is structured as follows Section \ref{sec:background} briefly describes beaver ecology, agricultural production in Scotland, and the reemergence, in the 2000s, of beavers in Scotland. Section \ref{sec:data} reviews the data. Section \ref{sec:methods} describes my empirical approach, including data construction and regression specifications. Section \ref{sec:results} presents results on reduced-form beaver impacts on agriculture, as well as suggestive evidence on mechanisms. Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications for policy. \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes and points toward future research.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item In the face of climate change, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss, there is a lot of focus on wildlife reintroductions.
%     \item In many cases, reintroduced wildlife will interact with the human environment, producing a range of positive and negative externalities (spreading disease, predators that eat livestock, highway collisions, ecology-disrupting brumbies, etc.). 
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item These conflicts with human environments is due, in part, to the history of human development going hand in hand with the destruction of wild habitats (e.g., draining swamps to establish agriculture). 
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item One salient example are the ongoing conflicts over the coexistence of human agriculture and the beaver, an ecosystem engineer which alters the course of rivers, establishes wetlands, fells timber, and grazes on vegetation. While the benefits of beaver presence have been well-documented, reliable cost estimates are rare. Farmers are a frequent opponent to beaver presence (cite examples from the beaver conflict literature). In Scotland, farmers have expressed dismay over a recent reemergence of beavers (here, give context for Kennedy Brexit quote).  
%     \item The recent unplanned, unauthorized establishment of a now-massive beaver population in the agriculturally valuable Scottish region around the River Tay (hereafter, ``Tayside'') presents a valuable natural experiment to estimate the general impact of beaver habitation on agricultural viability. Exogenous to ag policy, climate change (compare to Arctic expansion \citep{tape_expanding_2022}), or wildlife management regime.
%     \item To my knowledge, only one study has assessed the agriculture impacts of the Tayside beavers \citep{hamilton_tayside_2015}. Detail how this paper expands on and improves Scott's estimation procedure.
%     \item Using data on beaver expansion, agricultural activity, and river levels, I estimate the impact of the Tayside beavers on a range of farm outcomes.
%     \item I find \textcolor{red}{X} effect.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Compare my estimates to \citep{hamilton_tayside_2015} and others.

%     \item I contribute to the literature on:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Beaver costs and benefits
%         \item More broadly, wildlife reintroductions and cohabitation.
