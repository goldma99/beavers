To estimate the impact of beaver reintroduction on agricultural productivity, I acquire data on the Tayside beaver expansion, as well as indicators of agricultural functioning, including [variables] \todo{Fill in when I get variables from Ag Stats}. To assess potential damage mechanisms at a coarse resolution, I use data from an extensive network of hydrometry monitors placed in rivers across the UK.
