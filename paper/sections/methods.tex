I estimate response functions to beavers of both local environmental characteristics (namely, stream level and flow intensity) and land used for agriculture.

\subsection{Environmental Response to Beaver Entry}

Using [n] number of landscape grid cells in which I observe beaver entry, I estimate the classic two-period difference-in-difference model

\begin{equation} \label{eq:did_main}
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \beta^{b}D_{it} + \mathbf{X}_{it} + \epsilon_{it},
\end{equation}

where $y_{it}$ are the environmental outcomes (stream level and flow), $\beta^b$ is the effect of being treated by beaver presence, $D_{it}$ captures beaver treatment, $\mathbf{X}_{it}$ is a vector of time varying local environmental characteristics, and $\epsilon$ is a random error term. $\alpha_i$ and $\gamma_t$ capture grid cell and pre-and post-period fixed effects, respectively.



\subsection{Land Use Change}

Using the model specified in \eqref{eq:did_main}, I estimate the impacts of beaver entry on the proportion of land area in a grid cell that is in agricultural use.
