In Table \ref{table:beaver_main_ag_share_all_samples}, I report estimates from Equation \ref{eq:main_beaver_eq} of agriculture land use changes following beaver entry. In column (1), which includes all treated cohorts (2012, 2017, and 2020) and all grid cells (both those directly on-river and those inland), beaver entry increases the share of land devoted to agriculture by 1.7 p.p. (13.6\% relative to mean). This effect remains stable over a range of samples shown across the columns. Of particular interest are columns (2), (4), and (6), which only include grid cells that overlap with a watercourse, which are known to be those directly impacted by beaver habitation. See Appendix \ref{sec:addl_results} for evidence on changes to the physical environment.
