I estimate response functions to beavers of both local environmental characteristics (namely, stream level and flow intensity) and land used for agriculture.

\subsection{River Characteristics}

Using [n] number of landscape grid cells in which I observe beaver entry, I estimate the classic two-period difference-in-difference model

\begin{equation} \label{eq:main_beaver_eq}
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \beta^{b}D_{it} + \mathbf{X}_{it} + \epsilon_{it},
\end{equation}
where $y_{it}$ are environmental outcomes (river level and flow), $\beta^b$ is the effect of being treated by beaver presence, $D_{it}$ captures beaver treatment, $\mathbf{X}_{it}$ is a vector of time varying local environmental characteristics, and $\epsilon$ is a random error term. $\alpha_i$ and $\gamma_t$ capture grid cell and pre-and post-period fixed effects, respectively. In data aggregation, year $t \in [1990, 2000] \mapsto \gamma = 0$. For the sample including all ever-treated cohorts, $t \in [2020, 2022] \mapsto \gamma = 1$. For the sample including only 2012 and 2017 treated cohorts, $t \in [2017, 2022] \mapsto \gamma = 1$. For the sample including only 2012-treated cohort, $t \in [2012, 2022] \mapsto \gamma = 1$.



\subsection{Agricultural Land Use}

Using the model specified in Equation \eqref{eq:main_beaver_eq}, I estimate the impacts of beaver entry on the proportion of land area in a grid cell that is in agricultural use.
