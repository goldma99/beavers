	abstract = {Many areas are experiencing increasing stream temperatures due to climate change, and some are experiencing reduced summer stream flows and water availability. Because dam building and pond formation by beaver can increase water storage, stream cooling, and riparian ecosystem resilience, beaver have been proposed as a potential climate adaption tool. Despite the large number of studies that have evaluated how beaver activity may affect hydrology and water temperature, few experimental studies have quantified these outcomes following beaver relocation. We evaluated changes in temperature and water storage following the relocation of 69 beaver into 13 headwater stream reaches of the Skykomish River watershed within the Snohomish River basin, Washington, USA. We evaluated how beaver dams affected surface and groundwater storage and stream temperature. Successful relocations created 243 m3 of surface water storage per 100 m of stream in the first year following relocation. Dams raised water table elevations by up to 0.33 m and stored approximately 2.4 times as much groundwater as surface water per relocation reach. Stream reaches downstream of dams exhibited an average decrease of 2.3°C during summer base-flow conditions. We also assessed how dam age, condition, maintenance frequency, and pond morphology influenced stream temperature at naturally colonized wetland complexes. Our findings demonstrate that dam building can increase water storage and reduce stream temperatures in the first year following successful beaver relocation. Fluvial and floodplain morphology of candidate reaches for relocation is an important consideration because it determines the type and magnitude of response. Relocation to reaches with existing small, abandoned ponds may address thermal criteria by conversion from warming to cooling reaches, whereas relocation within large, abandoned complexes or vacant habitat may result in greater water storage. Although beaver relocation can be an effective climate adaptation strategy to retain more stable hydrologic regimes and water quality in our study area, there appear to be regionally specific environmental and geomorphic factors that influence how beaver affect water storage and temperature. More research is needed to investigate how and why these regional differences affect water storage and stream temperature response in beaver-influenced systems.},

	abstract = {Beaver damming creates and maintains riparian ecosystems in arid regions, which are often afflicted by seasonal and multi‐year droughts. We hypothesize that beaver ponds act as buffers against the effects of drought on nearby riparian vegetation via the following mechanism: Beaver ponds formed upstream of each dam retain water during wetter parts of the year, then during drier parts of the year, they gradually release that water into nearby soil where it is accessible to the roots of riparian vegetation. We calculated the evapotranspiration (ET) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of riparian vegetation on Susie and Maggie Creeks in northeastern Nevada from 2013 to 2016 and then compared the ET and NDVI to the location and intensity of beaver damming on the creeks. We found that the ET of riparian areas with beaver damming was 50–150\% higher than the ET in riparian areas without beaver damming and that NDVI in dammed riparian areas was 6–88\% higher than that in undammed areas. These differences peaked in mid‐summer when the landscape is at its hottest and driest state. There was no apparent loss of beaver pond drought buffering as a multi‐year drought (2013–2015) progressed. Our results indicate that riparian areas with beaver damming in arid landscapes are better able to maintain vegetation productivity than areas without beaver damming during both short and extended periods of drought.},

	abstract = {Small-scale discontinuities, formed by accumulations of wood, are recognised as a key feature of functionally intact forested streams because they promote organic matter retention, increase habitat complexity and provide flow refugia. Re-establishing such features in physically degraded streams is therefore a common priority for restoration schemes. Ecosystem engineering by beavers in the form of dam building might offer a natural mechanism for restoring degraded streams. Despite an increase in beaver reintroductions globally, the ecosystem engineering concept has rarely been applied to restoring biodiversity and ecosystem function, especially within degraded freshwater systems. By comparing multiple beaver-modified and unmodified sites on headwater streams draining 13 ha of pastureland in eastern Scotland, U.K., we investigated if hydromorphological changes caused by reintroduced beavers (Castor fiber) translate into desirable biological responses when there is a long history of physical degradation and contraction of the regional species pool due to agricultural land use. Beaver modified in-stream habitat by constructing 10 dams, thus creating a series of interconnected dam pools. Organic matter retention and aquatic plant biomass increased (7 and 20 fold higher respectively) in beaver ponds relative to unmodified channels, consistent with the lower fluctuation in stream stage observed below a series of dams. Growing season concentrations of extractable P and NO3 were on average 49\% and 43\% lower respectively below a series of dams than above, although colour and suspended solids concentrations increased. Macroinvertebrate samples from beaver-modified habitats were less taxon rich (alpha diversity on average 27\% lower) than those from unmodified stream habitat. However, due to significant compositional differences between beaver versus unmodified habitats, a composite sample from all habitats indicated increased richness at the landscape scale; gamma diversity was 28\% higher on average than in the absence of beaver-modified habitat. Feeding guild composition shifted from grazer/scraper and filter feeder dominance in unmodified habitats to shredder and collector-gatherer dominance in beaver-created habitats. Dam building by beaver in degraded environments can improve physical and biological diversity when viewed at a scale encompassing both modified and unmodified habitats. By restoring ecosystem processes locally, it may also offer wider scale benefits, including greater nutrient retention and flood attenuation. These benefits should be evaluated against evidence of any negative effects on land use or fisheries.},

	abstract = {Territoriality is only profitable when the benefits gained from territory exploitation exceed the costs of defence, and territory sizes are usually optimized by time constraints related to resource defence (e.g. patrolling) and exploitation. In this study, we equipped 25 dominant Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) with GPS units to study spatial movement patterns both on land and in water in relation to territory size, resource availability, the number of neighbours, season, and the beavers’ age. We show a territory size-dependent trade-off between territorial behaviours and foraging distances: Beavers in larger territories moved greater distances each night, thereby spending more time patrolling, and stayed closer to the shoreline when being on land (i.e. when foraging). Inversely, in smaller territories beavers patrolled less and foraged further away from the shoreline. These results suggest that individuals trade-off the costs of patrolling larger territories against the benefits of foraging closer towards the shoreline. Smaller territories might be more prone to resource depletion, thus, making foraging further from the shoreline a strategy to ensure sustainable resource use. Further, older beavers spent more time on land and close to territory borders compared to younger ones, suggesting a behavioural change with age possibly due to increased experience and boldness.},

	abstract = {The European beaver (Castor fiber) has extended its range into most Central European countries over the past 30 years, resulting in increased forestry damage and water management issues. As the number of beavers increases populations become established in new types of habitat. In the Czech Republic, for example, established beaver populations are now found on rivers flowing through agricultural landscapes, where living conditions differ significantly to those found in forest landscapes. To date, there have been no studies on the impact of beavers on agricultural production. The aim of this study was (1) to describe how beavers graze field crops, and (2) to estimate potential damage to agricultural production. This 2-year study examined five beaver territories in agricultural landscapes where crops were separated from watercourses by a narrow strip of bank vegetation. Beavers fed on all crop types grown in their territories throughout the growing period (May–October), peaking from mid-June to mid-July. The beavers clearly preferred oilseed rape, which (along with wheat and barley) represented the largest part of the grazed area. Rape was usually grazed at during vegetation growth and flowering, while cereals were usually grazed from the milk ripe kernel stage to harvest. Damage to agricultural production was up to €20–30 per ind./year. While beaver population density in the agricultural landscape remains low, damage to agricultural production is relatively insignificant; however, field crops clearly represent an important part of the beavers’ diet in such areas, helping them survive in such open landscapes.},

	url = {https://www.islandecho.co.uk/wildlife-trust-addresses-farmers-concerns-over-isle-of-wight-beaver-introduction/},
	abstract = {More than 70 farmers and landowners attended a meeting organised by the NFU (National Farmers' Union) about beaver introduction on Tuesday 5th April.

The meeting took place at The Chequers Inn, near Rookley, and helped farmers to understand the impact that a beaver introduction by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust (HIWWT) could have on the farmed landscape of the Isle of Wight, should it be licensed.

The Wildlife Trust’s beaver officer outlined how beaver impacts could be managed, with measures including:

 	electric fencing of crops
 	sandpaper paint or galvanised fencing to protect trees
 	removal of trees and other sources of food from certain areas to discourage beaver establishment
 	reinforcement of riverbanks with stone or galvanised mesh to discourage burrowing.

Farmers from the Tay catchment in Scotland, where there are more than 1,000 beavers, and farmers from the Stour, in Kent, joined the meeting virtually, sharing their experiences of living with wild populations of beavers. The meeting was also addressed by the NFU’s national adviser on species reintroductions.

Those attending the meeting learned of significant damage to low lying arable land, like that in the Arreton Valley, caused by the burrowing and damming activities of beaver, graphically illustrated by photographic evidence.

Damage to public access routes was highlighted. Concerns were raised about where responsibility and culpability for injury would fall if damage by beavers led to the collapse of footpaths or bridleways on a farmer’s land - a further cost someone must take responsibility for.



Isle of Wight NFU chair Robyn Munt, of Parkwater Farm, Newport, said:
“Should a licence be granted, there would need to be intense monitoring of beaver activity by HIWWT within the entire Eastern Yar catchment. What remains unclear is who would cover the cost of these management options in the long term. HIWWT must demonstrate its ability to take responsibility for such costs during a five-year or 10-year licence period. However, beyond that, being a charitable organisation, it can only make assurances and cannot commit to financial responsibility in perpetuity if beavers were to spread across the Island.

“The NFU is lobbying for the managers of beaver projects to take full responsibility for the cost of such projects in the long term. This would include the costs of an exit strategy, should unmanageable conflicts arise. Importantly, the NFU is asking Government to ensure that every beaver project establishes a steering group with farmer representation within each steering group. We will be looking for the same assurances around licence being drawn up for the Island beaver project.”},

	abstract = {Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) were nearly hunted to extinction but have recovered to occupy much of their former range. Beaver were extirpated from Great Britain c. 400 years ago but have recently been reintroduced. The River Otter catchment, Devon was the site of the first licensed wild release of beavers in England. With further releases being considered, there is a need to better understand population dynamics of this native, keystone species to inform conservation and management. Field signs were surveyed from 2015 to 2021. A semi-automated territory detection method was adopted to estimate territory counts. A spatially explicit model was developed to estimate the ecological territory capacity of the catchment. Future territory expansion was modelled using logistic growth curves; initial growth rate was estimated from observed territory counts and the estimated territory capacity range was used to define the limiting value of the growth curve. Beaver territory removal was simulated, across a range of management intensities and start times, to determine potential impacts of translocation or lethal control upon population dynamics. Territory numbers increased from four to 18, inclusive of four additionally released individuals, during study period. In the absence of population management, the territory capacity of the catchment was estimated to range between 120 and 183; this may be reached between 2028 and 2057. Simulated territory removal, where territories were removed at a fixed rate from the sum of the estimated total population and the population increase for that year, demonstrated large uncertainties in predicted population responses. Simulations with territory removals {\textgreater}3/year all predicted potential population collapse. This finding emphasizes the need for caution when considering population management strategies; translocation of animals out of the catchment or culling should be considered only when populations are established and all alternatives have been considered. These results provide critical information for the expected rate and magnitude of beaver population change in the River Otter catchment. The methods provide a reproducible and generalizable approach for understanding beaver population change, which can inform policy on the reintroduction of beavers and the potential timing and intensity of future beaver population management.},

	title = {Floods},
	abstract = {Floods threaten a quarter of the world’s population, most of whom live in poor countries. How do floods impact economic development, and how do households adapt? To answer these questions, I first combine methods from geophysics and machine learning in the analysis of satellite data to detect inundation at a granular geographic level anywhere every day for the past two decades. Using this approach in Bangladesh, I find that floods cause a persistent decline in economic activity and force structural change by pushing employment out of agriculture, spurring migration, and shifting children into school. Places with recent exposure to floods experience less harm after subsequent inundation. Using a simple model of experience-driven adaptation, I derive empirical tests for two mechanisms underpinning this pattern and find evidence for both. In a survey of rural farmers, I first show that past flood exposure increases the perceived marginal benefit of adaptation investment by raising households’ beliefs about future disaster risk and damages. I next find that the marginal cost of coping with floods via temporary urban migration declines in inundation experience. Consistent with this “learning-by-doing” channel, reduced mobility frictions identified from quasi-random variation in Colonial-era transportation networks mediate the differential treatment effects of past flood exposure. Together, my results indicate that endogenous adaptation will significantly reduce the damage from future flooding.},

Dams built by beaver (Castor canadensis) dramatically alter riparian landscapes throughout much of North America. In the central Adirondacks, New York, USA, ecosystem engineering by beaver leads to the formation of extensive wetland habitat capable of supporting herbaceous plant species not found elsewhere in the riparian zone. We show that by increasing habitat heterogeneity, beaver increase the number of species of herbaceous plants in the riparian zone by over 33\% at a scale that encompasses both beaver-modified patches and patches with no history of beaver occupation. We suggest that ecosystem engineers will increase species richness at the landscape scale whenever there are species present in a landscape that are restricted to engineered habitats during at least some stages of their life cycle.},

Beavers (Castor canadensis) in Mississippi have seen signifi cant population fl uctuations over the last 150 years as their status has changed from a game species to protected species to nuisance species. The objectives of this study were to assess the beaver-caused economic impacts to the timber industry in Mississippi and estimate the damages avoided due to Mississippi's Beaver Control Assistance Program (BCAP) activities from 2005 to 2009. The total BCAP costs averaged \$1.1 million annually over the study period. Analysis of 6 combinations of possible timber savings provided average annual direct program benefi ts that ranged from \$25 million to \$57 million. To estimate the potential secondary impact to the regional economy from these timber savings, an input-output model was utilized. The additional economic activity created in the region ranged from \$19 million to \$42 million. Using these estimated values of potential beaver damage, all calculated benefi t-cost ratios indicated that BCAP was an economically effi cient expenditure of resources. The economic methodology used herein can be applied to other integrated pest management programs to assess the economic effi ciency of expenditures.},

Despite extensive research, debate and consultation, a general consensus on the impact of beaver on fishes has proven elusive because of variability in biological response. This paper provides a systematic review of the impacts of beaver dams on fishes and fish habitat based on a meta-analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Research is regionally biased to North America (88\%). The most frequently cited benefits of beaver dams were increased habitat heterogeneity, rearing and overwintering habitat and flow refuge, and invertebrate production. Impeded fish movement because of dams, siltation of spawning habitat and low oxygen levels in ponds were the most often cited negative impacts. Benefits (184) were cited more frequently than costs (119). Impacts were spatially and temporally variable and differed with species. The majority of 49 North American and European experts considered beaver to have an overall positive impact on fish populations, through their influence on abundance and productivity. Perceived negative effects related to the movement of aquatic organisms in tributary streams, including upstream and downstream migrating salmonids, and the availability of suitable spawning habitat. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This challenge is especially evident in Massachusetts, USA, where furbearer management has been constrained by passage of a ballot initiative that outlawed use of foothold and body-gripping traps except in specific instances involving threats to human health or safety. Without regulated trapping, beaver (Castor canadensis) populations and damage attributed to them have increased. To develop an understanding of public attitudes regarding beaver-related management issues, we surveyed a random sample of Massachusetts residents in the spring of 2002 within 3 geographic regions where beaver are prevalent, as well as all individuals who submitted a beaver-related complaint to the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife in 1999 and 2000. We found that respondents held generally positive attitudes toward beaver. Respondents who experienced beaver-related problems tended to have less favorable or negative attitudes toward beaver than people who did not experience beaver damage. Attitudes toward beaver became increasingly negative as the severity of damage experienced by people increased. We believe continued public support for wildlife conservation will require implementation of strategies that are responsive to changing attitudes of an urban population and within social-acceptance and biological carrying capacities.},

	abstract = {Shallow open water wetlands provide critical habitat for numerous species, yet they have become increasingly vulnerable to drought and warming temperatures and are often reduced in size and depth or disappear during drought. We examined how temperature, precipitation and beaver (Castor canadensis) activity influenced the area of open water in wetlands over a 54-year period in the mixed-wood boreal region of east-central Alberta, Canada. This entire glacial landscape with intermittently connected drainage patterns and shallow wetland lakes with few streams lost all beaver in the 19th century, with beaver returning to the study area in 1954. We assessed the area of open water in wetlands using 12 aerial photo mosaics from 1948 to 2002, which covered wet and dry periods, when beaver were absent on the landscape to a time when they had become well established. The number of active beaver lodges explained over 80\% of the variability in the area of open water during that period. Temperature, precipitation and climatic variables were much less important than beaver in maintaining open water areas. In addition, during wet and dry years, the presence of beaver was associated with a 9-fold increase in open water area when compared to a period when beaver were absent from those same sites. Thus, beaver have a dramatic influence on the creation and maintenance of wetlands even during extreme drought. Given the important role of beaver in wetland preservation and in light of a drying climate in this region, their removal should be considered a wetland disturbance that should be avoided. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to CO2 and short-lived climate forcers, wildland fires release CO, non-methane organic compounds (NMOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2), NH3, and SO2. These species play a role in radiative forcing through their photochemical processing, which impacts atmospheric levels of CO2, CH4, tropospheric O3, and aerosol.

	abstract = {Summary: Accurately measuring the rate of spread for expanding populations is important for reliably predicting their future spread, as well as for evaluating the effect of different conditions and management activities on that rate of spread. Although a number of methods have been developed for such measurement, all these are designed only for one- or two-dimensional spread. Species dispersing along rivers, however, require specific methods due to the distinctly branching structure of river networks. In this study, we analyse data regarding Eurasian beavers' modern recolonization of the Czech Republic. We developed a new methodology for quantifying spread of species dispersing along streams based on representation of the river network by means of a weighted graph. We defined two different network-based spread rate measures, one estimating the rate of range expansion, with the range defined as the total length of occupied streams, and the second, named range diameter, quantifying the progress along one or several main streams. In addition, we estimated the population growth rates, and, dividing the population size by the range size, we measured the density of beaver records within their overall range. Using linear regression, we compared four beaver populations under different environmental conditions in terms of each of these measures. Finally, we discuss the differences between our method and the classical approaches. Our method provided substantially higher spread rate values than did the classical methods. Both population growth and range expansion were found to follow logistic growth. In cases of there being no considerable barriers in dispersal routes, the rate of progress along main streams did not differ significantly among populations. In homogeneous environments, population densities remained relatively constant over time even though overall population sizes increased. This indicates that at large spatial scales, the population growth of beavers occurs through progressive space filling rather than increasing population density. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Beaver ponds have been shown to be hot spots of carbon trace gas flux, which begs the question, "What is the source of the carbon?" The density and stratigraphy of carbon storage was studied in soils of boreal beaver meadows, graminoid wetlands that develop after a beaver pond is abandoned and drained, at Voyageurs National Park on the U.S.-Canada border, where beaver re-colonized the landscape during the latter half of the 20th century. Carbon density was measured to a depth of 60cm by collecting volumetric samples in mineral soils from the side walls of hand-dug trenches and in a Histosol using a box corer. Interpretation of pre-beaver (1940) aerial imagery showed the presence of cedar swamps in locations that currently have Haplosaprists and Argiaquolls, with deep carbon storage that cannot be attributed to recent beaver activity. Excluding these sites, carbon density to a depth of 60cm was still significantly greater in beaver meadow pedons (15.1±6.8kgm-2) than in adjacent forest soils that had not been impounded (8.2±2.9kgm-2). The difference was attributed to the accumulation of graminoid plant debris in thick surface O horizons. Volumetric carbon concentrations were greatest in O horizons, and a linear regression between O horizon thickness and carbon density was significant. Parent material origin (i.e., glacio-fluvial vs. glacio-lacustrine) did not significantly affect carbon density. This research confirms the presence of soil carbon adequate to supply trace gas fluxes, but suggests that considerable carbon is sequestered by beaver impoundments in the meadow stage, which may offset carbon release that occurs during the pond stage. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We examined seasonal and annual rates of nitrate transformations in three beaver ponds in Rhode Island under enriched nitrate-nitrogen (N) conditions through the use of N mass balance techniques on soil core mesocosm incubations. We recovered approximately 93\% of the nitrate N from our mesocosm incubations. Of the added nitrate N, 22 to 39\% was transformed during the course of the incubation. Denitrification had the highest rates of transformation (97-236 mg N m d), followed by assimilation into the organic soil N pool (41-93 mg N m d) and ammonium generation (11-14 mg N m d). Our denitrification rates exceeded those in several studies of freshwater ponds and wetlands; however, rates in those ecosystems may have been limited by low concentrations of nitrate. Assuming a density of 0.7 beaver ponds km of catchment area, we estimated that in nitrate-enriched watersheds, beaver pond denitrification can remove approximately 50 to 450 kg nitrate N km catchment area. In rural watersheds of southern New England with high N loading (i.e., 1000 kg km), denitrification from beaver ponds may remove 5 to 45\% of watershed nitrate N loading.

To inform land managers of trends on protected landscapes and identify potential conservation strategies, we collected occurrence data for five wetland-breeding amphibian species in four national parks in the U.S. Rocky Mountains during 2002-2011. We used explicit dynamics models to estimate variation in annual occupancy, extinction, and colonization of wetlands according to summer drought and several biophysical characteristics (e.g., wetland size, elevation), including the influence of North American beaver (. Castor canadensis). We found more declines in occupancy than increases, especially in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks (NP), where three of four species declined since 2002. However, most species in Rocky Mountain NP were too rare to include in our analysis, which likely reflects significant historical declines. Although beaver were uncommon, their creation or modification of wetlands was associated with higher colonization rates for 4 of 5 amphibian species, producing a 34\% increase in occupancy in beaver-influenced wetlands compared to wetlands without beaver influence. Also, colonization rates and occupancy of boreal toads (. Anaxyrus boreas) and Columbia spotted frogs (. Rana luteiventris) were ≥2 times higher in beaver-influenced wetlands. These strong relationships suggest management for beaver that fosters amphibian recovery could counter declines in some areas. Our data reinforce reports of widespread declines of formerly and currently common species, even in areas assumed to be protected from most forms of human disturbance, and demonstrate the close ecological association between beaver and wetland-dependent species.},

We conducted a watershed-scale experiment to test how increasing beaver dam and colony persistence in a highly degraded incised stream affects the freshwater production of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Following the installation of beaver dam analogs (BDAs), we observed significant increases in the density, survival and production of juvenile steelhead without impacting upstream and downstream migrations. The steelhead response occurred as the quantity and complexity of their habitat increased. This study is the first large-scale experiment to quantify the benefits of beavers and BDAs to a fish population and its habitat. Beaver mediated restoration may be a viable and efficient strategy to recover ecosystem function of previously incised streams and to increase the production of imperiled fish populations.},

Consequently, beaver activity has implications for a wide range of environmental ecosystem services including biodiversity, flood risk mitigation, water quality, and sustainable drinking water provision. With the current debate surrounding the reintroduction of beavers into the United Kingdom, it is critical to be able to monitor the impact of beavers upon the environment. This study presents the first proof of concept results showing how a lightweight hexacopter fitted with a simple digital camera can be used to derive orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM) data products at a site where beavers have recently been reintroduced. Early results indicate that analysis of the fine-scale (0.01 m) orthophoto and DSM can be used to identify impacts on the ecosystem structure including the extent of dams and associated ponds, and changes in vegetation structure due to beaver tree-felling activity. Unmanned aerial vehicle data acquisition offers an effective toolkit for regular repeat monitoring at fine spatial resolution, which is a critical attribute for monitoring rapidly changing and difficult to access beaver-impacted ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In Scotland, UK, beavers became extinct about 400 years ago. Currently, two wild populations are present in Scotland on a trial basis, and the case for their full reintroduction is currently being considered by Scottish ministers. Beavers are widely considered ‘ecosystem engineers’. Indeed, beavers have large impacts on the environment, fundamentally change ecosystems, and create unusual habitats, often considered unique. In this review, we investigate the mechanisms by which beavers act as ecosystem engineers, and then discuss the possible impacts of beavers on the biodiversity of Scotland. A meta-analysis of published studies on beavers’ interactions with biodiversity was conducted, and the balance of positive and negative interactions with plants, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals recorded. The meta-analysis showed that, overall, beavers have an overwhelmingly positive influence on biodiversity. Beavers’ ability to modify the environment means that they fundamentally increase habitat heterogeneity. As beavers are central-place foragers that feed only in close proximity to watercourses, their herbivory is unevenly spread in the landscape. In addition, beaver ponds and their associated unique successional stages increase habitat heterogeneity both spatially and temporally. Beavers also influence the ecosystems through the creation of a variety of features such as dams and lodges, important habitat features such as standing dead wood (after inundation), an increase in woody debris, and a graded edge between terrestrial and aquatic habitats that is rich in structural complexity. In Scotland, a widespread positive influence on biodiversity is expected, if beavers are widely reintroduced. For instance, beaver activity should provide important habitat for the otter Lutra lutra, great crested newt Triturus cristatus and water vole Arvicola amphibious, all species of conservation importance. Beavers are most likely to have detrimental impacts on certain woodland habitats and species of conservation importance, such as the Atlantic hazelwood climax community and aspen Populus tremula woodland. A lack of woodland regeneration caused by high deer abundance could lead to habitat degradation or loss. These are also of particular importance due to the variety of associated dependent species of conservation interest, such as lichen communities in Atlantic hazelwoods.},

This ecosystem engineer can cause considerable damage to human infrastructures and agriculture, by feeding, digging and damming. To prevent human–wildlife conflict and ensure continued support from the local residents, a better understanding of habitat selection is required. By using species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify habitat requirements in our study area in Flanders, Belgium, based on 1792 occurrence data from 71 territories, and a fine-scale land use and vegetation map, we explored the potential for future beaver settlements. The results indicate that even in a highly human-dominated landscape, there is sufficient habitat available to support beaver populations. We highlight the importance of distance to water, willow stands, wetland vegetation and poplar trees. We show that there is currently sufficient habitat to support 924 territories (619–1515, 90\% confidence interval) in Flanders (but this does not imply these locations are conflict-free). Our findings indicate that 12 year after the reintroduction, there continues to be a large expansion potential, both in range and in densities within the currently recolonized area. Our results can be used as a management tool in order to evaluate possible risks linked with the return of beavers in a human dominated landscape. At these critical locations, increased monitoring or structural measures can prevent conflicts. By preventing or quickly resolving human wildlife conflicts, long-term coexistence between humans and beavers can be achieved.},

	abstract = {Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y−1 (95\% CI 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y−1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO2e−1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a {\textgreater}66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2−1. Most NCS actions—if effectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

In the context of the Paris Climate Agreement, countries submitted their (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions ((I)NDCs), including climate mitigation targets. Assuming full implementation of (I)NDCs, we show that land use, and forests in particular, emerge as a key component of the Paris Agreement: turning globally from a net anthropogenic source during 1990–2010 (1.3 ± 1.1 GtCO2e yr−1) to a net sink of carbon by 2030 (up to −1.1 ± 0.5 GtCO2e yr−1), and providing a quarter of emission reductions planned by countries. Realizing and tracking this mitigation potential requires more transparency in countries’ pledges and enhanced science-policy cooperation to increase confidence in numbers, including reconciling the ≍3\&nbsp;GtCO2e yr−1 difference in estimates between country reports and scientific studies. Forests are a key component of the Paris Agreement, providing about a quarter of planned emission reductions.

We hypothesize that beaver ponds act as buffers against the effects of drought on nearby riparian vegetation via the following mechanism: Beaver ponds formed upstream of each dam retain water during wetter parts of the year, then during drier parts of the year, they gradually release that water into nearby soil where it is accessible to the roots of riparian vegetation. We calculated the evapotranspiration (ET) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of riparian vegetation on Susie and Maggie Creeks in north-eastern Nevada from 2013 to 2016 and then compared the ET and NDVI to the location and intensity of beaver damming on the creeks. We found that the ET of riparian areas with beaver damming was 50–150\% higher than the ET in riparian areas without beaver damming and that NDVI in dammed riparian areas was 6–88\% higher than that in undammed areas. These differences peaked in mid-summer when the landscape is at its hottest and driest state. There was no apparent loss of beaver pond drought buffering as a multi-year drought (2013–2015) progressed. Our results indicate that riparian areas with beaver damming in arid landscapes are better able to maintain vegetation productivity than areas without beaver damming during both short and extended periods of drought.},

Here we present evidence of the recent range expansion of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) into the Arctic, and consider how this ecosystem engineer might reshape the landscape, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes. We developed a remote sensing approach that maps formation and disappearance of ponds associated with beaver activity. Since 1999, 56 new beaver pond complexes were identified, indicating that beavers are colonizing a predominantly tundra region (18,293 km2) of northwest Alaska. It is unclear how improved tundra stream habitat, population rebound following overtrapping for furs, or other factors are contributing to beaver range expansion. We discuss rates and likely routes of tundra beaver colonization, as well as effects on permafrost, stream ice regimes, and freshwater and riparian habitat. Beaver ponds and associated hydrologic changes are thawing permafrost. Pond formation increases winter water temperatures in the pond and downstream, likely creating new and more varied aquatic habitat, but specific biological implications are unknown. Beavers create dynamic wetlands and are agents of disturbance that may enhance ecosystem responses to warming in the Arctic.},

This was a historic moment: the first formally approved reintroduction of a mammal species anywhere in the United Kingdom. The issues surrounding beaver reintroduction to Scotland had been the subject of intense investigation and public debate over the previous 21 years. Extensive multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work was performed to assess the desirability and feasibility of reintroducing the Eurasian beaver and informed the government's decision. This was one of the most detailed assessments carried out for any species reintroduction proposal. The work was broadly divided into desk-based and stand-alone studies based primarily on the European and North American experience of living with beavers, the scientifically monitored Scottish Beaver Trial reintroduction in west Scotland, a study of beavers resulting from unauthorised releases in an east Scotland catchment and the work of a specialist group that examined beaver–salmonid interactions and issues. It was confirmed that beavers have a very positive influence on biodiversity overall, although some specific species and habitats of high conservation importance can be adversely affected if appropriate management is not in place. Beavers provide a range of ecosystem services with the potential for socio-economic benefits. However, beavers' activities may affect some land uses, the extent and significance depending on local conditions. Management techniques are well developed, although some will require refinement and appropriate licensing within a Scottish regulatory regime. A strategic approach to developing management throughout Scotland will need to be progressed in partnership with key stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Beavers are known for their ability to build dams that change the environment. They also occupy territories where they do not construct dams. The goal of this study was to determine which environmental factors influence beaver dam construction and to examine the upstream water level increase caused by the dams. We compared factors collected at 15 beaver territories with dams (32 dams) and 13 territories without dams (i.e., control) in the gently undulating and human-dominated landscape of Middle Belgium in 2013. River width, river depth, distance from woody vegetation, stream velocity, and bank height differed significantly between territories with and without dams. Water depth was the most important parameter to correctly classify territories as either dam territory or control territory (with 97\% accuracy). When beavers were present and water depth in summer was {\textless}68 cm, the probability of dam building was high; if water depth was {\textgreater}68 cm, dam building was unlikely. Dams caused an increase in the upstream water level of on average 47 ± 21 cm. On average the water level could rise only an additional 25 ± 30 cm upstream of the dam before bank overtopping would occur. These results provide a simple tool for planners to assess the probability of floodplain inundation by beaver dam building, as part of multifunctional riverine landscape management. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

The influence of selected atmospheric factors and beaver behaviour aspects on the number of compensation claims was also analyzed. The majority of damages resulting from beavers’ negative impact on the human economy were related to the flooding of grasslands. The second and third most prevalent types of damage were tree cutting and flooding of tree stands, respectively. Most losses were reported in spring and summer months, which suggest that preventive measures should be undertaken mainly during that period. There were no significant relationships between the number of filed claims, temperature and precipitation levels in the analyzed years.},

	abstract = {Through their dam-building activities and subsequent water storage, beaver have the potential to restore riparian ecosystems and offset some of the predicted effects of climate change by modulating streamflow. Thus, it is not surprising that reintroducing beaver to watersheds from which they have been extirpated is an often-used restoration and climate-adaptation strategy. Identifying sites for reintroduction, however, requires detailed information about habitat factors—information that is not often available at broad spatial scales. Here we explore the potential for beaver relocation throughout the Snohomish River Basin in Washington, USA with a model that identifies some of the basic building blocks of beaver habitat suitability and does so by relying solely on remotely sensed data. More specifically, we developed a generalized intrinsic potential model that draws on remotely sensed measures of stream gradient, stream width, and valley width to identify where beaver could become established if suitable vegetation were to be present. Thus, the model serves as a preliminary screening tool that can be applied over relatively large extents. We applied the model to 5,019 stream km and assessed the ability of the model to correctly predict beaver habitat by surveying for beavers in 352 stream reaches. To further assess the potential for relocation, we assessed land ownership, use, and land cover in the landscape surrounding stream reaches with varying levels of intrinsic potential. Model results showed that 33\% of streams had moderate or high intrinsic potential for beaver habitat. We found that no site that was classified as having low intrinsic potential had any sign of beavers and that beaver were absent from nearly three quarters of potentially suitable sites, indicating that there are factors preventing the local population from occupying these areas. Of the riparian areas around streams with high intrinsic potential for beaver, 38\% are on public lands and 17\% are on large tracts of privately-owned timber land. Thus, although there are a large number of areas that could be suitable for relocation and restoration using beavers, current land use patterns may substantially limit feasibility in these areas.},

	abstract = {Restoration of riparian and wet meadow ecosystems in semiarid rangelands of the western United States is a high priority given their ecological and hydrological importance in the region. However, traditional restoration approaches are often intensive and costly, limiting the extent over which they can be applied. Practitioners are increasingly trying new restoration techniques that are more cost-effective, less intensive, and can more practically scale up to the scope of degradation. Unfortunately, practitioners typically lack resources to undertake outcome-based evaluations necessary to judge the efficacy of these techniques. In this study, we use freely available, satellite remote sensing to explore changes in vegetation productivity (normalized difference vegetation index) of three distinct, low-tech, riparian and wet meadow restoration projects. Case studies are presented that range in geographic location (Colorado, Oregon, and Nevada), restoration practice (Zeedyk structures, beaver dam analogs, and grazing management), and time since implementation. Restoration practices resulted in increased vegetation productivity of up to 25\% and increased annual persistence of productive vegetation. Improvements in productivity with time since restoration suggest that elevated resilience may further enhance wildlife habitat and increase forage production. Long-term, documented outcomes of conservation are rare; we hope our findings empower practitioners to further monitor and explore the use of low-tech methods for restoration of ecohydrologic processes at meaningful spatial scales.},

To bring together understanding of the role that beavers may play in the management of water resources, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems, this article reviews the state-of-the-art scientific understanding of the beaver as the quintessential ecosystem engineer. This review has a European focus but examines key research considering both Castor fiber—the Eurasian beaver and Castor canadensis—its North American counterpart. In recent decades species reintroductions across Europe, concurrent with natural expansion of refugia populations has led to the return of C. fiber to much of its European range with recent reviews estimating that the C. fiber population in Europe numbers over 1.5 million individuals. As such, there is an increasing need for understanding of the impacts of beaver in intensively populated and managed, contemporary European landscapes. This review summarizes how beaver impact: (a) ecosystem structure and geomorphology, (b) hydrology and water resources, (c) water quality, (d) freshwater ecology, and (e) humans and society. It concludes by examining future considerations that may need to be resolved as beavers further expand in the northern hemisphere with an emphasis upon the ecosystem services that they can provide and the associated management that will be necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize conflicts.

Since the beginning of the 21st\&nbsp;century, efforts have been made to manage the Polish beaver population by hunting without changing a protected species' status.

	abstract = {Beaver dams are gaining popularity as a low-tech, low-cost strategy to build climate resiliency at the landscape scale. They slow and store water that can be accessed by riparian vegetation during dry periods, effectively protecting riparian ecosystems from droughts. Whether or not this protection extends to wildfire has been discussed anecdotally but has not been examined in a scientific context. We used remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to compare riparian vegetation greenness in areas with and without beaver damming during wildfire. We include data from five large wildfires of varying burn severity and dominant landcover settings in the western United States in our analysis. We found that beaver-dammed riparian corridors are relatively unaffected by wildfire when compared to similar riparian corridors without beaver damming. On average, the decrease in NDVI during fire in areas without beaver is 3.05 times as large as it is in areas with beaver. However, plant greenness rebounded in the year after wildfire regardless of beaver activity. Thus, we conclude that, while beaver activity does not necessarily play a role in riparian vegetation post-fire resilience, it does play a significant role in riparian vegetation fire resistance and refugia creation.},

The smaller population size and range of the native Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) compared to the non-native North American beaver (Castor canadensis) in Finland raise questions on reasons for the slower range expansion of the native species. We compared the population growth rates and the spread of both species from their release sites. We also studied the factors possibly affecting the spread of the Eurasian beaver in South western Finland in more detail. We found that the North American beaver has spread longer distances than the Eurasian beaver, but we did not find evidence for movement barriers constraining the expansion rate of the native species. Lack of high-quality habitats does not seem to constrain the expansion to nearby areas either. Despite this, the Eurasian beaver population has grown to a high density close to its reintroduction site, and it has started to spread to novel areas only recently. We conclude that the expansion of the native beaver in Finland seems to be controlled by factors other than those related to barriers for movement: movement behavior and population dynamics, which require further investigation.},

Activity of the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber and the North American beaver Castor canadensis in the landscape provides ecosystem services and disservices. Services produced by beaver activity include water purification, moderation of extreme events, habitat and biodiversity provision, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas sequestration, recreational hunting and fishing, water supply, and non-consumptive recreation. Beaver-produced services have not been compiled, analysed, or quantified previously. Each service we evaluated is worth millions to hundreds of millions of US dollars (USD) annually. Habitat and biodiversity provision (133 million USD), along with greenhouse gas sequestration (75 million USD), are particularly valuable services in absolute terms, while non-consumptive recreation (167 USD ha−1) and habitat and biodiversity provision (133 USD ha−1) have the largest annual per-hectare values. Our results can be used to broaden decision-making and management perspectives, as we offer value estimates to wildlife managers and municipality planners for assessing local site-specific beaver wetland values and the opportunities for their realisation. Implementing Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes offer a concrete way for societies to benefit from beaver-produced services while concurrently compensating beaver-produced losses accrued to landowners. Building such schemes offer long-term realisation of ecosystem services and damage mitigation. This would lead to increased societal well-being and increased conservation interest and efforts.},

Yet, changes in land use and ecosystem services alongside growing climate variability are altering hydrologic extremes and their coupled impacts on riverine water quality. In the western U.S., warming temperatures and intensified aridification are increasingly paired with the expanding range of the American beaver—and their dams, which transform hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles in riparian systems. Here, we show that beaver dams overshadow climatic hydrologic extremes in their effects on water residence time and oxygen and nitrogen fluxes in the riparian subsurface. In a mountainous watershed in Colorado, U.S.A., we find that the increase in riparian hydraulic gradients imposed by a beaver dam is 10.7–13.3 times greater than seasonal hydrologic extremes. The massive hydraulic gradient increases hyporheic nitrate removal by 44.2\% relative to seasonal extremes alone. A drier, hotter climate in the western U.S. will further expand the range of beavers and magnify their impacts on watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry, illustrating that ecosystem feedbacks to climate change will alter water quality in river systems. Beaver dams increase water flow gradients and nitrate removal far more than seasonal climate extremes. An expanding beaver range is an ecosystem feedback to climate change which could improve water quality.},

These higher C stocks are primarily from avoided emissions from deforestation and degradation in PAs compared to unprotected forests. This total is roughly equivalent to one year of annual global fossil fuel emissions. These results underscore the importance of conservation of high biomass forests for avoiding carbon emissions and preserving future sequestration. Protected areas are important for climate change mitigation.

Despite regional variation, the predictions demonstrated remarkable consistency at a global scale, with only\&nbsp;a 12\% difference between the ground-sourced and satellite-derived estimates. At present, global forest carbon storage is markedly under the natural potential, with a total deficit of 226 Gt (model range = 151–363 Gt) in areas with low human footprint. Most (61\%, 139 Gt C) of this potential is in areas with existing forests, in which ecosystem protection can allow forests to recover to maturity. The remaining 39\% (87 Gt C) of potential lies in regions in which forests have been removed or fragmented.

	abstract = {Extreme wildfires are becoming more common and increasingly affecting Earth’s climate. Wildfires in boreal forests have attracted much less attention than those in tropical forests, although boreal forests are one of the most extensive biomes on Earth and are experiencing the fastest warming. We used a satellite-based atmospheric inversion system to monitor fire emissions in boreal forests. Wildfires are rapidly expanding into boreal forests with emerging warmer and drier fire seasons. Boreal fires, typically accounting for 10\% of global fire carbon dioxide emissions, contributed 23\% (0.48 billion metric tons of carbon) in 2021, by far the highest fraction since 2000. 2021 was an abnormal year because North American and Eurasian boreal forests synchronously experienced their greatest water deficit. Increasing numbers of extreme boreal fires and stronger climate–fire feedbacks challenge climate mitigation efforts.},

	abstract = {Beaver engineering in the Arctic tundra induces hydrologic and geomorphic changes that are favorable to methane (CH4) production. Beaver-mediated methane emissions are driven by inundation of existing vegetation, conversion from lotic to lentic systems, accumulation of organic rich sediments, elevated water tables, anaerobic conditions, and thawing permafrost. Ground-based measurements of CH4 emissions from beaver ponds in permafrost landscapes are scarce, but hyperspectral remote sensing data (AVIRIS-NG) permit mapping of ‘hotspots’ thought to represent locations of high CH4 emission. We surveyed a 429.5 km2 area in Northwestern Alaska using hyperspectral airborne imaging spectroscopy at ∼5 m pixel resolution (14.7 million observations) to examine spatial relationships between CH4 hotspots and 118 beaver ponds. AVIRIS-NG CH4 hotspots covered 0.539\% (2.3 km2) of the study area, and were concentrated within 30 m of waterbodies. Comparing beaver ponds to all non-beaver waterbodies (including waterbodies {\textgreater}450 m from beaver-affected water), we found significantly greater CH4 hotspot occurrences around beaver ponds, extending to a distance of 60 m. We found a 51\% greater CH4 hotspot occurrence ratio around beaver ponds relative to nearby non-beaver waterbodies. Dammed lake outlets showed no significant differences in CH4 hotspot ratios compared to non-beaver lakes, likely due to little change in inundation extent. The enhancement in AVIRIS-NG CH4 hotspots adjacent to beaver ponds is an example of a new disturbance regime, wrought by an ecosystem engineer, accelerating the effects of climate change in the Arctic. As beavers continue to expand into the Arctic and reshape lowland ecosystems, we expect continued wetland creation, permafrost thaw and alteration of the Arctic carbon cycle, as well as myriad physical and biological changes.},

	abstract = {Constraining the climate crisis requires urgent action to reduce anthropogenic emissions while simultaneously removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Improved information about the maximum magnitude and spatial distribution of opportunities for additional land-based removals of CO2 is needed to guide on-the-ground decision-making about where to implement climate change mitigation strategies. Here, we present a globally consistent spatial dataset (approximately 500-m resolution) of current, potential, and unrealized potential carbon storage in woody plant biomass and soil organic matter. We also provide a framework for prioritizing actions related to the restoration, management, and maintenance of woody carbon stocks and associated soils. By comparing current to potential carbon storage, while excluding areas critical to food production and human habitation, we find 287 petagrams (PgC) of unrealized potential storage opportunity, of which 78\% (224 PgC) is in biomass and 22\% (63 PgC) is in soil. Improved management of existing forests may offer nearly three-fourths (206 PgC) of the total unrealized potential, with the majority (71\%) concentrated in tropical ecosystems. However, climate change is a source of considerable uncertainty. While additional research is needed to understand the impact of natural disturbances and biophysical feedbacks, we project that the potential for additional carbon storage in woody biomass will increase (+17\%) by 2050 despite projected decreases (212\%) in the tropics. Our results establish an absolute reference point and conceptual framework for national and jurisdictional prioritization of locations and actions to increase land-based carbon storage.},

	abstract = {Natural climate solutions (NCS) are recognized as an important tool for governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. Using California as a globally relevant reference, we evaluate the magnitude of biological climate mitigation potential from NCS starting in 2020 under four climate change scenarios. By mid-century NCS implementation leads to a large increase in net carbon stored, flipping the state from a net source to a net sink in two scenarios. Forest and conservation land management strategies make up 85\% of all NCS emissions reductions by 2050, with agricultural strategies accounting for the remaining 15\%. The most severe climate change impacts on ecosystem carbon materialize in the latter half of the century with three scenarios resulting in California ecosystems becoming a net source of carbon emissions under a baseline trajectory. However, NCS provide a strong attenuating effect, reducing land carbon emissions 41–54\% by 2100 with total costs of deployment of 752–777 million USD annually through 2050. Rapid implementation of a portfolio of NCS interventions provides long-term investment in protecting ecosystem carbon in the face of climate change driven disturbances. This open-source, spatially-explicit framework can help evaluate risks to NCS carbon storage stability, implementation costs, and overall mitigation potential for NCS at jurisdictional scales.},

	abstract = {The engineering activities of the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber have far-reaching effects on the components of an environment and therefore modify the functioning of the ecosystem. The wetlands thereby created are the most conspicuous effect of beaver activity and attract water-related species. However, there is some evidence suggesting that beavers influence not only aquatic ecosystems but also the terrestrial habitats adjacent to these wetlands and the organisms occurring there. Because the impact of beavers on terrestrial birds is still poorly understood, this study evaluates the assemblage of birds wintering on beaver sites (N = 65) and paired reference sites (N = 65) in temperate forests of central Europe. We investigated the correlations between beaver presence, parameters of wetland areas, terrestrial vegetation characteristics, distance from the water's edge and bird species richness and abundance. We found a greater species richness and abundance of wintering birds on beaver sites than on watercourses unmodified by this ecosystem engineer (by 38\% and 61\%, respectively). Species richness and abundance were higher in the terrestrial habitats near the edges of beaver ponds, but for some species this tendency also held in forests growing at some distance from beaver wetlands. Greater species richness was related to beaver presence, but also increased with a more open canopy and greater forest floor diversity, whereas bird abundance was correlated only with canopy openness. The beaver sites attracted primary cavity nesters, secondary cavity nesters and frugivorous species. This study provides evidence that the engineering activities of beavers during the growing season have a delayed cascading effect on the richness and abundance of the bird assemblage in terrestrial habitats in winter. This indicates that beaver ecosystem engineering should be seen as having a potential for carry-over effects, in which the consequences of beaver activity become apparent in subsequent seasons. Birds are considered to be ecological indicators, so our results highlight the importance of beavers for the distribution of terrestrial organisms at the local scale, and therefore the functioning of ecosystems beyond the immediate wetland area.},
