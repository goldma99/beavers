A large literature has described how natural capital enters the economic production function. For example, climatic conditions, wildlife, and pests may alter productivity. But \textit{ex-ante}, operators may not know the direction and magnitude of a given natural capital input's effect, leading risk-averse agents to neutralize potential threats. Such actions may be welfare reducing if control operations degrade ecosystem functioning, reduce biodiversity, or eliminate an ecosystem service's positive externalities. A salient example is the conflict between wildlife and agriculture. Farming operations have historically relied on the producer's or state's ability to control habitats, cull livestock predators and crop grazers, repel potential vectors of disease transmission, and eliminate crop-eating pests with mass insecticide use. In the past two decades, the US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services has killed 56 million wild animals, including some otherwise protected by the Endangered Species Act, to protect livestock capital (\cite{torrella_inside_2024}). Pesticides used to protect crop yields negatively impact human and animal health \citep{larsen_agricultural_2017}, leading in part to the formation of the modern American environmental movement \citep{woodwell_broken_1984}. The Chinese ``Four Pests Campaign'' encouraged the mass killing of sparrows, believed to feed on grain reservoirs, and inadvertently eliminated sparrows' valuable pest-control services, playing a role in the subsequent mass famine \citep{frank_campaigning_2024}. 

Balancing risk-reduction for economic production and ecosystem protection is complicated by climate change, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss \citep{cardinale_biodiversity_2012}. Indeed, misunderstanding the role keystone species play in supporting their ecosystems can distort wildlife management policy; recent evidence has challenged long-held beliefs about so-called ``nuisance'' species (e.g., \cite{raynor_wolves_2021}). But scant empirical evidence details how economic production adapts to changes in the composition of natural capital with latent .

The beaver (\textit{Castor canadensis} in North America\footnote{Kuhl, 1820} and \textit{Castor fiber} in Europe and Western Asia\footnote{Linnaeus, 1758}) occupies the dual roles of agricultural menace and crucial ecosystem engineer. Since the expansion of agriculture in Europe and America, farm operators have often killed beavers and destroyed their colonies to avoid the flooding, crop grazing, and timber felling. After being hunted to near-extinction until the 19th Century, the beaver has been reintroduced in many parts of North America and Europe. In recent years, a plethora of positive externalities produced by beavers has been documented, from wetland preservation \citep{hood_beaver_2008}, temperature regulation (\cite{dittbrenner_relocated_2022}), and carbon storage (\cite{wohl_landscape-scale_2013}, \cite{johnston_beaver_2014}) to wildfire resistance \citep{fairfax_smokey_2020} and species richness \citep{wright_ecosystem_2002}.

A recent unplanned, unsanctioned reemergence of beavers in Scotland, where they had not appeared in centuries, illustrates this conflict. Consistent with historical examples of farmer-led opposition to beaver habitation, agricultural groups have opposed beaver incursion into the agriculturally valuable region around the River Tay (hereafter, ``Tayside''), with the president of the National Farmers Union, Scotland (NFUS) warning that beavers pose a greater threat than Brexit to his constituents \citep{castle_beavers_2021}. In nearby Southern England, which has seen several controlled releases, residents have posted public banners vowing to oppose beaver invasion (\cite{itooksomephotos_say_2022}).  In Bavaria, where beavers reemerged in the 20th Century, farming organizations campaigned for their complete eradication (\cite{campbell-palmer_managing_2015}). Despite the opposition, Scotland granted beavers protected status in 2019. Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests heterogeneous effects, with some farmers living in proximity to newly arrived beavers reporting no adverse effects, (\cite{campbell_rd_naturescot_2012}), while others complain of enormous monetary damages incurred by beaver activity (\cite{hamilton_tayside_2015}).

The case of the Scottish beaver can inform wildlife management policy. Exogenous to agricultural policy, climate change,\footnote{Not all beaver expansion has been uncorrelated with the identification-confounding effects of climate change. In recent decades, the warming Arctic tundra has proved fertile habitat for beavers \citep{tape_expanding_2022}, which are further altering the environment via their colonies' methane production \citep{clark_beaver_2023}.} or wildlife management regime shifts, the rapid spread of the beaver in Scotland  allows one to estimate the causal impact on agricultural land use.

To identify beaver movement over time, I employ a set of periodic comprehensive regional surveys, conducted between 2012 and 2020. To test whether beaver presence affects cropping behavior, I match high-resolution land use data to beaver arrival. Because multiple channels exist by which beavers may harm agricultural operations, I provide suggestive evidence for the most commonly cited mechanism: flooding. Using a network of hydrometry monitoring stations, I measure changes in river level and flow in response to beaver presence.

I find mixed evidence for beaver impacts. In my preferred specification, beaver arrival is associated with a 4.6 p.p. \textit{increase} in the share of landscape grid cells\footnote{I refer to these units synonymously as landscape patches.} devoted to agricultural land use, an 11\% change relative to the average agricultural land share in my sample. This effect is stable across a range of cohort and grid cell subsamples. River level and flow rate, which beavers have been found to alter \citep{swinnen_environmental_2019}, lower noisily in response to beaver introduction. In preliminary analysis, it remains unclear whether the beaver-caused increase in share of land devoted to agriculture reflects true changes in cropping, or either a) the greening effect of beaver colonization or b) reallocation of cropping within farm properties. Further study, using satellite data to measure water saturation and flooding directly at a finer scale, as well as agricultural census data on farm productivity and income, may clarify the causal relationship.

This paper contributes an understanding of how natural capital enters the agricultural production function. A large literature details the impact of weather and climate on agricultural yield and economic growth (\cite{mendelsohn_impact_1994}, \cite{schlenker_impact_2006}, \cite{schlenker_nonlinear_2009}, \cite{hsiang_causal_2014}, \cite{taylor_environmental_2021}), while a small but growing field of studies treat wildlife as a natural capital input (\cite{frank_economic_2024}, \cite{rucker_colony_2019}, \cite{champetier_bioeconomics_2015}, \cite{kawasaki_impact_2023}, \cite{devkota_assessing_2024}). This study also adds to findings on the valuation and accounting of natural capital more broadly (\cite{lewis_nature_2024}, \cite{raynor_wolves_2021}, \cite{fenichel_measuring_2016}, \cite{fenichel_natural_2014}, \cite{kareiva_natural_2011}). Finally, it contributes evidence of the environmental effects of beaver habitation to a mature literature in ecology, whose findings I discuss further in section \ref{sec:background-beavers}. To my knowledge, I am the first to study, in a quasi-experimental setting, the impact of the beaver on the extensive margin of resource use.

The paper is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:background} describes the Scottish agricultural industry, beaver ecology, and the recent beaver recolonization of Scotland. Section \ref{sec:data} reviews the data. Section \ref{sec:methods} describes my empirical approach. Section \ref{sec:results} presents results on reduced-form beaver impacts on agriculture, as well as suggestive evidence on mechanisms. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes and points toward future research.
