Conclude

\begin{itemize}
    \item Natural capital enters the ag production function
    \item Given that its effect on productivity can often be (assumed to be) negative, lots of control happens
    \item Sometimes the control is welfare-reducing
    \item I study a quasi-experiment in Scotland, measuring the effect of beavers on agricultural land use
    \item Find an extensive margin increase in land utilization from beaver entry
    \item Mechanisms unclear
    \item Implies control/prevention operations should take into account these land use increases when allocating resources
